## Terminology
> "git gets easier once you get the basic idea that branches are homeomorphic endofunctors mapping submanifolds of a Hilbert space."
>> Isaac Wolkerstorfer

<Notes>
  I will be giving somewhat official definitions for terminology from my notes. The definitions in the slides are my understanding of the terms, AKA in "Jakie speak".

### Pull Request (PR)

I request that you pull these changes into your main code base.

<Notes>

  Definition from [OSS Watch](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/pullrequest) - A pull request occurs when a developer asks for changes committed to an external repository to be considered for inclusion in a project’s main repository.

</Notes>

---
### Rebase

Slide my changes back into the code base's commit history where I started making them.

<Notes>

  From [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing) site - It works by going to the common ancestor of the two branches (the one you’re on and the one you’re rebasing onto), getting the diff introduced by each commit of the branch you’re on, saving those diffs to temporary files, resetting the current branch to the same commit as the branch you are rebasing onto, and finally applying each change in turn.

</Notes>

### Merge conflict

Me and someone else made changes in the same place and confused the computer.

<Notes>

  Merge conflicts happen when you merge branches that have competing commits, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge.

  Sometimes there are competing changes that Git can't resolve without your help. Often, merge conflicts happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.

## Git as a superpower

Git allows you to...

<UnorderedList listStyle="none" textAlign="left">
  <Appear>
    <li>Time travel through a project</li>
    <li>Break stuff with the exuberant careless joy of a child</li>
    <li>Work with others and feel like a real software engineer (especially if you have a cool command line theme)</li>
    <li>Teach, learn, and grow more patient/understanding of how others write code</li>
  </Appear>
</UnorderedList>

---
## Code review

Code review is quite possibly the most important piece of using git in an enterprise setting or with any large team. Having a good code review policy helps ensure code is clean, knowledge about the code base is spread, and team members learn from and teach other.

__Be polite, but don't be afraid of expressing an opinion or having frank discussion with your team.__

## Popular Git Workflows

It really doesn't matter which workflow you use, but it important to use one that the team can agree upon. It can be an established workflow from the community, or you can make one up.

### Github Flow
GitHub Flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects where deployments are made regularly. This guide explains how and why GitHub Flow works.

### Gitflow
Gitflow Workflow is a Git workflow design that was first published and made popular by Vincent Driessen at nvie. The Gitflow Workflow defines a strict branching model designed around the project release. This provides a robust framework for managing larger projects.

### Trunk Based Development
A source-control branching model, where developers collaborate on code in a single branch called ‘trunk’ *, resist any pressure to create other long-lived development branches by employing documented techniques. They therefore avoid merge hell, do not break the build, and live happily ever after.
